<h1>Lauren Dragon</h1>

<p>Having just returned from the West Coast, where she made her LA debut and premiered her self-written/self-produced one woman show in Las Vegas, Lauren Dragon is currently in the studio with industry veteran Gary Allen Shay recording her upcoming CD Mosaic, and preparing to audition on Broadway and in Hollywood for theatre and films. 
<br>
Shay just closed a 3 year contract for Lauren with the prestigious Marty Conn National Artists Enterprises.  Shay, Conn and Dragon have now formed a team which is already bringing in lucrative contracts for Lauren.  Look for Lauren to sing with the Atlanta Pop Symphony in April. – From Lauren’s MySpace (myspace.com/soulfuldragon).
