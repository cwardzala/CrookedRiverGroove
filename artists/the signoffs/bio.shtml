<h1>The Signoffs</h1><p>Hardcore too tuneless for you? Punk too rudimentary, with its dearth of solos? Metal too wanky? Stoner Rock too dopey and slow? But you still like the hard stuff? Then you're gonna love The Signoffs. They have the speed of hardcore, hooks of punk, the heaviousity of stoner rock, and still manage to toss off cogent flying fingers solos literally without missing a beat. And in shades of early Replacements, three of them just turned 18 and the fourth is still in high school. Another bunch of Cleveland boys may have snagged Young, Loud, And Snotty as a record title, but these guys are ten times the band that The Dead Boys were. There are eleven tracks and every one kicks like a donkey on crystal meth. Sure, Stiv and Co may always have the edge when it comes to historical significance, but I don't listen to history, I listen to music. How 'bout you? Ð From Tone and Groove (John F. Butland)  R.I.P.</p>
