<h1>Patrick Sweany</h1>

<p>Patrick Sweany is probably best known for his memorable performances at some of the country's premier blues and roots festivals over the years. The Massillon, OH native has hit every honky tonk, pub and festival in the Midwest and South over the last 6 years, averaging over 150 gigs per year. These gigs have included Merlefest, The Eureka Springs Blues Festival, The King Biscuit Blues Festival, among others. Both solo and with The Patrick Sweany Band (Clint Alguire on drums and Bob Basone on baritone guitar), he continues to draw accolades for his respectful, yet inventive interpretations of the blues. For his new release C'mon C'mere, Sweany recruited producers Jimbo Mathus (Buddy Guy, North Mississippi All Stars) and Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys) to strike the perfect balance of relevance and reverence. – From patricksweany.com</p>
