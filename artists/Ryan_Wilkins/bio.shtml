<h1>Ryan Wilkins</h1>

<p>Ryan Wilkins was born in Michigan, but spent most of his formative years in Columbus, Ohio. Ryan has always had a passion for music, even from the time when he began to walk.  As a freshman in college, he picked up the guitar and taught himself how to play. Almost immediately, he had an interest in playing the songs he had written in front of others. A year after teaching himself how to play, Ryan and some Young Life leaders started a band (Floyd Dallis), which enjoyed regional success in the Midwest. Coming out of that experience, Ryan played locally in Columbus and surrounding areas as a solo artist. At that time Ryan also found a desire to lead worship music and invested in it as a volunteer at a church in Columbus. While he was serving as a youth pastor at a local church, Ryan played in a band with blues and roots influences as lead singer and rhythm guitarist. – From sevenosevon.com</p>
