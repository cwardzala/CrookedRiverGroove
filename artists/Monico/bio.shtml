<h1>Monico</h1>

<p>Liberally embracing eclectic musical influences, the group has cultivated a sound that draws the listener back again and again. Monico’s core is the tightly knit rhythm section of Dave Trace and Ray Brown. Veterans of many years in regional music projects, Dave and Ray read each other artistically with an ease that is almost supernatural. From this base, they searched for the right voice and found it in Jason Kilbey “Jay” Smith. Jay had already established a formidable reputation as a singer/songwriter and quickly became the foundation for the band’s creative process.   The essence of Monico’s sound was formed during this embryonic stage and has evolved and developed further with the frequent inclusion longtime friend, Dave Baker, whose unparalleled artistry complements and enhances the trio’s signature musical versatility. Monico has now matured into an entity carving its niche in the local and regional markets, building a solid fan base, thrilling listeners, and filling venues with the band’s meticulously polished live set. – From Monico’s MySpace (myspace.com/monicoband)</p>
