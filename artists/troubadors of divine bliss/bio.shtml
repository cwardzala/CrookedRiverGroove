<h1>Troubadours of Divine Bliss</h1><p>The Troubadours of Divine Bliss are two women from Louisville, Kentucky whose music was born in New Orleans. They met 16 years ago in a “holy rollin’” Charismatic church, where they became best friends. Then they went their separate ways for a while until the universe brought them back together in 1995. With a vision of being modern-day troubadours who travel the world encouraging revolution of the spirit and “the courage of heart that frees your dream,” they followed their destiny to the streets of New Orleans. There, with an accordion and a guitar (wrapped in battery-operated Christmas lights), Renee and Aim Me debuted as the Christmas Carolers.Countless performances and two CDs later, they are singing their way around the U.S., Canada, and Europe at festivals, universities, nightclubs, restaurants, coffeehouses... anywhere and everywhere the Spirit leads. – From ket.org<p>
