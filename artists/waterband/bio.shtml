Waterband's sonic depth and changing forms allow them to perform as a dynamic acoustic ensemble or as a full-blown electric aural assault.  With a massive array of influences, drawing from classic rock, blues, funk, folk, and jazz as well as the ability to cover other artist's classic songs, Waterband is sure to please a diverse audience.  Waterband has performed over 700 shows since forming in 2001, in venues ranging from concert halls, local pubs and coffee shops, to weddings and corporate/political functions as well as radio and television throughout the Midwest and East coast all with positive response.
