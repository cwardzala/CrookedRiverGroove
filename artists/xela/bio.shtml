<h1>Xe La</h1>
<p>Born &amp; bred on the North Coast, Xe La is the music of ALEX ALVAREZ. Child of musicians and artists, the craft of creativity was deeply part of his life before grade school. Fondly distracted by area forests and wild urban atmospheres, inspiration guided his spirit into worlds of folklore and streetwise knowledge. From camping fireside to squattin' in warehouses, Cleveland brought Xe La to the reality of his surroundings, leading to the establishment called LUV MUTHA. Xe La writes, records, publishes, &amp; distributes all his works independently through networking, gigs and performances around the country. </p>
