<h1>Jack Fords</h1>
<p>The Jack Fords are a Cleveland based band that is the result of the relationships forged at the Town Fryer's Sunday night Roots jams. With Bobby Latina (guitar), Brent Kirby (vocals, guitar) and new members Chris Yohn (bass), and Greg Campolieti (drums), the band has established themselves as a hard working band with a loyal fan base. Their debut live CD Bent Outta Shape received rave reviews and they are currently working on their follow up record due to be released in spring 2007. – From Jack Ford’s MySpace (myspace.com/jackfords)</p>
