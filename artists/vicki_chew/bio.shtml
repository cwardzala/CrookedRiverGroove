The Bells of St. Rose is Vicki’s second CD.  The first was recorded with “Under the Tree” nearly a decade ago.  Although the musical styles are different, the songs are as well conceived and performed as ever.</p><p>Regional fans of Cleveland singer/songwriter Vicki Chew have undoubtedly heard Vicki play some of the tunes on the Bells of St. Rose, but they’ve never heard them like this.  The jazz-oriented Jackie Warren Trio provides a fresh counterpoint to the hard-won honesty of the lyrics and Vicki’s clear, bell-like vocals.  The result is a little bit Joni Mitchell, a little bit Nora Jones.  Mostly, though, the music is at that perpetually new place where sophistication and simplicity come together.</p><p><a href="http://vickichewmusic.com">Vicki Chew Site</a> </p>
