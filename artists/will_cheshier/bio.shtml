Deftly rhythmic lyrics and picturesque stories are woven throughout, delivered by a strong clear voice over agile and densely complex guitar. </p><p>Although he’s now an established regional solo artist, Will cultivated his singular style with tenures in an eclectic chain of bands. They included progressive rock (Sign of Life), Britpop (Up Ten Yen), acid jazz (Headz) and jazz and blues influenced pop (Big Drunk Dummy) as well as top 40, funk and other combos. He has played shows with an equally diverse group of artists including Styx, Pat Benatar, Tony McAlpine, The Smithereens and The Greyboy Allstars. – From willcheshier.com</p><p><a href="http://Willcheshier.com">Will Cheshier Site</a> </p>
