<h1>Matt Gerovac </h1>
<P>Matt Gerovac, the son of musicians, spent his early years in a car seat on top of a bass amp - which could explain some of the hearing loss! They lived on the road, in hotels and following gigs until the family got a 9 month-turned-into-9 years contract to play in St. Thomas. </P>
<P>Caribbean music still influences Matt's music, as does Bob Marley, Curtis Mayfield, Jeff Buckley, Jim Croce, Ben Harper and Al Green. Matt explains. "I like to be pulled in a creative direction rather than trying to push or force myself." <BR><BR>Matt Gerovac Vocals/Guitar<BR>Corbett Hein&nbsp;Bass<BR>Andrew Rothman Drums<BR><BR><A href="mailto:sabhead2000@yahoo.com">sabhead2000@yahoo.com</A><BR></P>
